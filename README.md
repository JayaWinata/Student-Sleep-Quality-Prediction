# 💤 Student Sleep Quality Prediction

A machine learning pipeline designed to predict student sleep quality based on biometric and lifestyle-related input features. This solution utilizes a Random Forest model trained and deployed on **Amazon SageMaker**, with model artifacts managed in **Amazon S3**. It supports end-to-end processing—from training to real-time inference—using a custom entrypoint and containerized environment.

## 📌 Project Description

Sleep quality plays a critical role in students' academic performance and overall well-being. The goal of this project is to provide a scalable, cloud-based predictive system to classify the sleep quality of students on a scale of 1–10. It does this by analyzing physical and lifestyle metrics such as heart rate, stress level, and daily activity data.

By leveraging AWS SageMaker, the model can be trained and deployed efficiently, allowing seamless integration with applications or user interfaces for real-time predictions.
